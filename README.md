## AI Disclosure
AI tools were used to help debug issues with FlowRow and FlowColumn, interpret Compose and Material 3 requirements, and troubleshoot layout and state management problems. AI also guided me through the process of opting in to experimental Compose APIs and editing Gradle dependencies and configuration to enable the necessary libraries and features. No code was directly copied from AI output; all code was written and adapted by me, but AI played a role in problem-solving, debugging, and clarifying assignment requirements.
